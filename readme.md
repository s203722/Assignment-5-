## Learning experience

Throughout the course, our group has evolved a lot in our knowledge of IFC and programming. Primarily, we have gained a basic understanding of the possibilities and limitations of IFC, which we can use in further work with computational modelling etc. At the beginning of the course, we hardly knew what the format was, moreover, it had been a long time since we tried programming. Although we did not end up as OpenBIM Champions with a vast understanding of IfcOpenShell and Blender, we did get a grasp of what possibilities there are. Possibilities, which we can explore further in the future if it is relevant. We still lack knowledge on the specifics of IFC formatting, what is contained and how is it done, furthermore, we lack the ability to fully utilize the tools necessary to extract this data. All in all, we have gained a basic understanding of IFC and have been introduced to some tools and methods, with which we can develop scripts that use the data.

Regarding our BIM project, in the beginning, we had difficulties understanding the IFC format and the programming language IfcOpenShell. The process was characterized by self-learning, which was frustrating at times. However, we managed to gain a basic understanding of both, and we are proud of our product and concept. We enjoined how free and creative the exercise was.

We can foresee a future, in which we use OpenBIM and the knowledge we have gained throughout the course. Some of our group members have a great interest in computational design, which could very well evolve to a point where we integrate IFC. Similarly, we will definitely use open-source programs such as Blender in the future.

## Process of tutorial development

**A3:** We thought it was fun and motivating to develop a script within such a broad exercise. The freedom to choose between many different use cases sparked creativity which enhanced engagement with the theory. However, although the scope had no limits, we were limited by our experience with IfcOpenShell. We would have preferred more of an introduction to the tool, perhaps with some basic exercises. That way, imagination would be the only limiting factor. Working with an actual use case strengthened our understanding of the IFC format and the possibilities of Blender and open-source.

**A4**: It was interesting to develop a product and a tutorial for audiences with different experience in IFC and programming. It allowed us to reflect upon how much we had learned and how we communicate complex concepts. The tutorial process was very systematic, and through it, we gained a better understanding of our script syntax.

**A5:** We thought it was a good way to wrap up the course with a focus on communication and reflection. With a thorough reflection on the whole project, we realized how much we had accomplished.

## Received tutorial feedback

We were glad to get overly positive feedback on our project. The Peer Review groups thought that the tutorial was clear and that the use case was well addressed. Furthermore, they were impressed with our programming integration. However, there were also a few remarks. Regarding scope, they suggested that the program should be able to calculate a transportation plan instead of the necessary transportation for each window individually. However, they understood that the program was a prove of concept and that a project manager responsible for scheduling might want the data for each building component. Moreover, there was some confusion with the model export function, as the group had not used Blender programming before. Since the program should be usable without prior knowledge, this is valid. All in all, they liked the comments in the script, the tool, and the tutorial.

## Future for advanced use of OpenBIM

As described in the first section, we are very likely to use open-source tools and IFC formatting in the future. Although we don’t currently see a large integration of IFC in the market, this could change. Moreover, we could evolve and challenge the use of the tool with computational design. Throughout the course, we have gained an understanding of the importance of a common BIM data format, and the strengths and weaknesses of IFC. It seems highly useful to have the IFC data format for computational modelling in Grasshopper, Blender, etc. Hence, if we need to process information in a Building Information Model for our thesis or in our professional life, which we likely will, we will without a doubt investigate OpenBIM once again.

## Wrap up

In conclusion, throughout the course, we have gained knowledge on the possibilities and limitations of OpenBIM, we have been introduced to IFC, and we have learned about open-source tools such as BlenderBIM. Although we did not get a deep understanding of each element, we got an overall basic understanding of the concept of OpenBIM.

With A1, we learned how tedious it can be to handle IFC data manually, and we were introduced to the formatting, which we could explore in Excel. In A2, we were introduced to a simpler way than manual data handling, where we were able to explore the possibilities of OpenBIM in a creative way. With A3, we gained a better understanding of IfcOpenShell and the formatting of IFC. A4 taught us communication and highlighted how far we had come. Lastly, with this A5, we were able to reflect on all our work and the course as a whole.
